## Ownership Overlap Analysis

### Confirmed Overlaps

1. **`reports/`** — Owned by BOTH `09-qa` and `10-security`
   - Risk: MEDIUM — both write QA/security reports here
   - Mitigation: Each writes to their own subdirectory (`prompts/09-qa/reports/`, `prompts/10-security/reports/`), so actual conflict is low. But the `agents.conf` ownership string is ambiguous.

2. **`docs/`** — PM owns `prompts/` and `docs/` broadly; CTO owns `docs/architecture/`; CEO owns `docs/strategy/`; HR owns `docs/team/`
   - Risk: LOW — subdirectory ownership is clear, PM's broad ownership acts as fallback

3. **`prompts/`** — PM owns all of `prompts/`, HR owns `prompts/13-hr/`
   - Risk: LOW — HR only writes to own subdirectory, PM is coordinator by design

### No Overlaps (Clean)
- `scripts/`, `src/core/`, `src/lib/` — Backend only
- `site/` — Web only
- `src/pixel/` — Pixel only
